- Identify the transaction which are fraud. If our algorithm predicts a transaction as non fraudulent but actually the transaction is fraudulent then it is big loss for the Auto insurance company hence the goal of this ML modeling is to minimize the False Negative. Hence the Recall should be close to One.

- Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for __theft__ and __fraud committed__ using or involving a payment card, such aas credit or debit card, as  __fraudulent source__ of funds in a transaction. 
- The purpose may be to obtain goods without paying, or to obtain __unautorized funds from an account__.
- Credit card fraud is also and adjunt to __identity__ theft.
- Building a robust model so that credit card companies are able to recognize the fraudulent card transactions so that customets are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
