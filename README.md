- Identify the transaction which are fraud. If our algorithm predicts a transaction as non fraudulent but actually the transaction is fraudulent then it is big loss for the Auto insurance company hence the goal of this ML modeling is to minimize the False Negative. Hence the Recall should be close to One.

### [Breast Cancer Diagnosis](./BreastCancerDiagnosis)
(image/fraud.jpg)<br><br>
- Breast cancer is a prevalent cause of death, and it is the only type of cancer that is widespread among women worldwide. Many imaging techniques have been developed for early detection and treatment of breast cancer and to reduce the number of deaths and many aided breast cancer diagnosis methods have been used to increase the diagnostic accuracy 
- There have been several empirical studies addressing breast cancer using machine learning and soft computing techniques. Many claim that their algorithms are faster, easier, or more accurate than others are. This study is based on genetic programming and machine learning algorithms that aim to construct a system to accurately differentiate between benign and malignant breast tumors. The aim of this study was to optimize the learning algorithm. In this context, we applied the genetic programming technique to select the best features and perfect parameter values of the machine learning classifiers. The performance of the proposed method was based on sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, and the roc curves. The present study proves that genetic programming can automatically find the best model by combining feature preprocessing methods and classifier algorithms

### [Letter Recognition](./LetterRecognition)

- The objective is to identify each of a large number of black-and-white rectangular pixel displays as one of the 26 capital letters in the English alphabet. The character images were based on 20 different fonts and each letter within these 20 fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of 20,000 unique stimuli. Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive numerical attributes (statistical moments and edge counts) which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0 through 15. We typically train on the first 16000 items and then use the resulting model to predict the letter category for the remaining 4000. See the article cited above for more details.
